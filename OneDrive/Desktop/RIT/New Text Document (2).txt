A
the problem of classifying EXP cry signals, the DFFNN, SVM, NB, and PNN achieved an accuracy of 99.92%±0.00, 61.15%±0.04, 58.11%±0.01, and 56.71%±0.01, respectively. In addition, the obtained sensitivity is 99.85%±0.00, 61.03%±0.04, 56.31%±0.01, and 57.70%±0.03, respectively, for DFFNN, SVM, NB, and PNN. In terms of specificity, the DFFNN, SVM, NB, and PNN obtained 100%, 61.27%±0.05, and 59.93%±0.02, and 55.72%±0.02, respectively

B.
the problem of classifying INS cry signals, the DFFNN achieved perfect accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity. The linear SVM, NB, and PNN, respectively, achieved an accuracy of 59.57%±0.01, 55.46%±0.02, and 52.63%±0.05, a sensitivity of 58.82%±0.04, 55.84%±0.01, and 47.10%±0.07, and a specificity of 60.32%±0.04, 55.08%±0.02, and 58.17%±0.06.
